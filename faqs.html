								<h3>
Q. What prior programming experience is required to be accepted into Hacker: University?</h3>
								<p>A. Of course a computer science and programming background is helpful, but it isn't required. 
We are here for those who do have the background and want to refine, extend, and put it all together, but we are also tailoring ourselves to those who have little to no formal experience and would like the structure, mentorship, and guidance our program offers to keep you on track and get you to a finish line. 
Ultimately we do not care what your background is.  We care about your aptitude and future. However, you need to be prepared to work extremely disciplined and diligent. If you are hungry, dedicated, and eager to learn, you will do very well.</p>

								<hr />

								<h4>
Q. Where are you located? Do I have to physically be there?</h4>
								<p>A. Particular details will not be disclosed here or at this point, but we will tell you that we are located in the beautiful and vibrant San Francisco Bay area as well as a few other national and international options will be in the mix. For now we will start in the one and only innovation capital of the world, Silicon Valley. Hosting near by treasure troves such as Napa Wine Country, Yosemite, the Redwoods, miles of beautiful coast line with spectacular towns like Santa Cruz, Monterey, San Luis Obispo,  and so much more. </p>
<p>And yes, you need to be here. Our program is all about the people and the personal touch they can have on your path and pursuit to becoming a skilled hacker.</p>


	<hr />

								<h4>Q. What are the start and end dates of each program?</h4>
								<p>A. Our programs will take place on a rolling basis; each program consisting of different dates and timeframes. Please see the schedules under our services tab here. (hyperlink) 
Note: All major holidays are observed, and the week of Thanksgiving will have no classes. When you apply, you'll have the chance to designate your desired session.</p>

	<hr />

								<h4>Q. Do I need a laptop? What else should I bring to the class?</h4>
								<p>A. Yes. You'll need to bring your own laptop to class. As a developer, designer, security analyst, or any technologist from here on out, you should be familiar and comfortable with all your equipment, tools, and projects to go with you after the program. Macs, Windows, or Linux machines will all work. You'll also need a headset to access video content within our learning platforms that will be utilized. We provide everything else you will need but you are welcome to bring whatever else you would like to make your time here comfortable and enjoyable.  We will discuss this more when on boarding you into the program before you come.</p>

	<hr />

								<h4>
Q. What kind of food is included?</h4>
								<p>A. We provide a good assortment of food for our program participants. Continental breakfast will be the norm in the mornings with some special occasions. Lunches and dinners will be hearty and healthy with plenty of snacks ranging in health quality.  In extended sessions there will be food available but not nearly as consistent or abundant quantities, so be prepared to have some extra budget available if you are planning on staying longer or want to enjoy many of the great restaurants provided by the local scene. Please disclose any special food allergies or preferences you have after you are accepted and confirmed to attend.</p>

	<hr />

								<h4>Q. I am moving to the area for the program, what are my options for housing?</h4>
								<p>A. Many of has have come from other bootcamps and have had our struggle with housing. We have founded our program around the living experience with other students. For a low room and board cost per month we have you taken care of. No more housing headaches, lost time commuting, or being out of touch with your team or project. In fact, we only expect local applicants not to stay with us. Not that it is a requirement.</p>

	<hr />

								<h4>Q. What would a typical day/week look like at Hacker: University?</h4>
								<p>A. That would depend on the day and the week of your selected path. You can expect a lot of reading and listening to tutorials, in addition to a lot of hands on exercises. Whether through your group leader or on your own, you will be actively putting the technology you are learning into practice through group building, team building, pair programming, and individual projects that will cover a range of interests and topics. </p>

	<hr />

								<h4>Q. What kind of outside activities can one expect from the program?</h4>
								<p>A. Our location based programs as well as our traveling program will have a number of options for you to explore outside of technology. Our group will look to provide team sporting activities, group and individual hobbies such as cooking, archery, guitar lessons, pool, ping pong, video games, movies, gardening and so forth. We believe in a balance of life and learning in every aspect. Given the program and location there will always be opportunities for you to travel outside our facilities and explore the local scene and events not provided by us.</p>

<hr />

								<h4>Q. Would it be possible to switch from one program to another?</h4>
								<p>A. Due to particular costs associated with our travel program, it wouldnâ€™t be possible to go from a location-based program to the travel program, but if traveling the world every three months becomes too much for you, we can make arrangements for you to join a home base with relative ease.</p>
